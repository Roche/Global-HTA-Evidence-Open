## gemtcPlus

This package implements some convinience functions for perfoming Bayesian NMA using the [gemtc package](https://github.com/gertvv/gemtc/) for standard models (binary data, hazard ratio data). It also contains some more advanced models for time-to-event data with time varying hazard ratios, such as fractional polynomial NMAs and piecewise exponential NMA models.

## MAIC

This package facilitates performing matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) anaylsis for a disconnected treatment network where the endpoint of interest is either time-to-event (e.g. overall survival) or binary (e.g. objective tumor response).
