- title: "Examples of reporting standard NMA"
  desc: >
    These examples illustrate how **gemtcPlus** can be used to simplify the 
    reporting of NMA performed via gemtc. Includes an example for an NMA 
    for Hazard Ratio (HR) and Odds Ratio (OR).

- title: "Examples of Time to Event NMA"
  desc: >
    These examples illustrate the use of more complex models included into
    gemtcPlus for handling NMA on time to event data without making proportional
    hazard assumptions. This includes Piecewise Exponential (PWE) models and 
    Fractional Polynomiol (FP) models with and without Random Effects (RE).
