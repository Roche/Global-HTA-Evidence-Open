# gemtcPlus

This package implements some convinience functions for perfoming Bayesian NMA using the [gemtc package](https://github.com/gertvv/gemtc/) for standard models (binary data, hazard ratio data). It also contains some more advanced models for time-to-event data with time varying hazard ratios, such as fractional polynomial NMAs and piecewise exponential NMA models.
