## Introduction
`DESforCEM` is a user-friendly package that facilitates the use of discrete event simulations without resource constraints for cost-effectiveness analysis.
The package supports a flexible, practical approach to discrete event simulation while keeping an acceptable performance through the use of parallel computing.

The current version supports:

* Discrete event simulation models, Markov/semi-Markov models and hybrid models
* Seamlessly integrating data.frames and other objects into the model
* Delayed execution of the main inputs to facilitate readability of the model
* Debugging mode with a non-parallel engine to facilitate error detection
* Implementation of structural and parameter uncertainty
* Helper functions to facilitate drawing of time to events and the use of hazard ratios
* Performing cost-effectiveness and uncertainty analysis

It is recommended that the user checks the vignettes, first the simple Sick-Sicker-Dead model [Sick-Sicker-Dead model](https://r.roche.com/s/a05ab15d44940de03bbbf/files/DESforCEM/docs/articles/example_ssd.html) and then the more complex model for [early breast cancer](https://r.roche.com/s/a05ab15d44940de03bbbf/files/DESforCEM/docs/articles/example_eBC.html). The [markov](https://r.roche.com/s/a05ab15d44940de03bbbf/files/DESforCEM/docs/articles/example_markov.html) example shows how to run a cohort Markov model while using the same modeling framework. Similarly, a simulation based Markov model could be run.
