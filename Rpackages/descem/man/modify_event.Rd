\title{Modify the time of existing events}
\usage{
modify_event(evt, env_ch = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{evt}{A list of events and their times}

\item{env_ch}{Environment in which to save list (should not be defined by user)}
}
\description{
Modify the time of existing events
}
\details{
The functions to add/modify events/inputs use lists. Whenever several inputs/events are added or modified, it's recommended to group them within one function, as it reduces the computation cost.
So rather than use two \code{modify_event} with a list of one element, it's better to group them into a single \code{modify_event} with a list of two elements.

\examples{
\dontrun{
modify_event(list("os"=40, "ttot"=curtime+0.0001))
}
